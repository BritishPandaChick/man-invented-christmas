          <div class="col-xs-6 half-width">
            <p><em>The Man Who Invented Christmas</em> tells the magical journey
              that led to the creation of Ebenezer Scrooge (Christopher Plummer),
              Tiny Tim and other classic characters from <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. Directed
              by Bharat Nalluri (<em>Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day</em>), the film
              shows how Charles Dickens (Dan Stevens) mixed real life inspirations
              with his vivid imagination to conjure up unforgettable characters
              and a timeless tale, forever changing the holiday season into the
              celebration we know today.</p>
